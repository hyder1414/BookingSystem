  ##  Introduction
   #### Purpose 
The purpose of this project report is to analyze current problems within the Southwest System and suggest improvements for the system. Analysis of the system had been made by the previous project and recommendations were also made at the conceptual level. In this report we will make more improvements of the previous project and make revisions that are required. 
    
   #### Problem Definition 
There are some problems within the current Southwest Airlines website. First, Southwest Airlines does not have any code-sharing contracts with other airlines. This limits their customer pool and prevents them from growing to a bigger airline. If Southwest Airlines had multiple contracts from international airlines, they would be able to attract more international customers into their business.  

The current Southwest Airlines website does not have an option for travelers going to multiple destinations when they make a reservation. Customers must make individual reservations for each flight. We believe that resolving this issue will improve the quality of Southwest Airlines service. Also, Southwest Airlines does not have a system to receive direct customer feedback. There might be some suggestions and recommendations from customers however, the company does not have any system to gather this information. Our team believes that implementing this system will help the marketing team advertise Southwest and improve the quality of the service. This will also give Southwest Airlines the reputation of frequent flyer interaction and their motivation to improve their service.
